			<p>
			In the Caribbean, most states rely on a single source of water for all domestic, agricultural, and industrial needs. The challenge of managing this limited resource is worsened by variations in precipitation brought on by climate change. Furthermore, the region lacks the skilled water resource and climate risk managers needed to develop effective strategies to cope with these problems.

			<p>
			The Water and Climate Education Program (WACEP) aims to tackle these issues by developing educational programs, research partnerships, and regional collaboration for professionals and upper-level students on water resource and climate risk issues. The first of four courses will be offered in September 2013.
